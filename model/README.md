# MODEL
A module for defining the system model for use in the Benchamark.

## Summary
This is the model level README - Welcome! The purpose of this module is to define a series of system models for use with different agent. In essence, this is completed by symbolically stating the system model, and then generating a series of anonymous functions that are evaluated by passing the system parameters, current state, current action, and any other required information. 

## Requirements
1. Python - I'm currently using V 3.8.0, not leveraging Tianhao's yaml (yml)
2. Sympy - I'm currently using  V 1.6
3. Numpy - I'm currently using V 1.18.5
4. Math and Time should be part of the Python Standard Library

## Usage

```python
python3 model.py
```
